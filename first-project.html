<h1 align=center>About Myself</h1>
<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>My name is Lance Kyi, a sophomore in Summit Public Schools: Shasta. This may be a boring website, and yes it is. I'm only in the class Intro to Computer Science with little to no prior knowledge in coding, yet to be able to pull off this website is quite the achievement for me. This is our first project for this Expeditions class. Let's see what else is on this list . . . . I'll write this out as a Q&A.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Where have you been in your life?</em> No where much. Mostly in the California region, some times in Nevada, one time in Hawaii and another time in</li>
  <li><em>What else do you want people to know about you?</em> I believe this should go at the end of this website.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What are your 2 favorite somethings? (books, movies, food, etc.)
